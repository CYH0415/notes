# Why tcp/ip
Network communication protocol -> format convention of data in network communication.
Protocol layering: in order to realize network interconnection, some organizations divide the complex network communication environment into multiple layers according to the different protocol interfaces provided by different services.
Classic OSI seven layer model (application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer, link layer, physical layer). The concrete functions of each layer are not introduced in detail
- The advantage of OSI is that the three concepts of service, interface and protocol are clearly separated. The concept is clear and the theory is relatively complete. Through seven hierarchical structure models different systems and different networks can realize reliable communication;
- But complex and impractical

# TCP/IP
The **Internet protocol suite** is the set of communication protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks. The current foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).
Because the network communication protocol generally adopts a layered structure (such as the OSI model above), when multiple layers of protocols work together, it is similar to the stack in computer science, so it is also called tcp/ip protocol stack
## So what is the association between OSI and TCP/IP?
Generally, people think that the top three lavers of OSI model (application laver, presentation laver and session layer) are an application layer in tcp/ip group. So we can consider the TCP/IP is the simple version of OSl. Here is the main 4 layers of TCP/IP. (maybe there is another physical layer, but we do not care about it here.)Among them, the top three layers is more important for us.

Now let's learn about the three layers generally.
# Application layer
## An example
For example :currently, a project about "order to take out" software is to be developed. One of its functions is to obtain the user's order history (the back-end server receives data from the database and returns it to the front-end page).
As we know, the front-end and back-end interaction is based on the network. So in the process of this interaction, we need to agree: what kind of data the front-end sends, and the back-end returns the corresponding data:

> (前端发的请求)发的请求需要包含:用户的id,查询的起始时间查询的结束时间显示的条数
> 回来的响应:(后端返回的数据)查询是否成功如果失败,失败的原因结果数组
> 数组的每个元素就包含了一些属性
> 商品名
> 商品单价
> 商品数量
> 店铺名称
> 总的金额

The above work is to design an application layer protocol.
Summary: when network communication is needed between applications, what needs to be done in the application layer of tcp/ip five layer protocol is that programmers customize the application layer protocol
# Common application layer protocols
- DNS: domain name resolution
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol
- telnet: remote terminal protocol
- http: hypertext transmission protocol, an important basis for reliable data exchange on the network
	- HTTP is **stateless**, that is to say
		- each http query is independent; the server has no way to figure out who you are from the message unless you prove it(for example, a Cookie is given)
		- Instead, maintenance of the states is done by the server: like Cookies and Sessions.
# Transport layer
The two most famous protocols in the transport layer are UDP and TCP, Whether the data sent by the sender and received by the receiver are the main concerns of the transport layer.
## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is an unconnected transmission protocol, which provides unreliable unconnected transmission services and is message oriented.
- No connection.
- Unreliable.
- More fast.
UDP messages have no reliability guarantee, sequence guarantee and flow control fields, so their reliability ispoor. However, because UDP protocol has few control options, it has small delays and high data transmissionefficiency in the process of data transmission, which is suitable for applications that do not require highreliability

# TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a very important transport layer protocol, which is widely used inpractical development. To ensure the security and efficiency, theimplementation of TCP is a little complex but not difficult, which we do notintroduce here.
1. TCP is connection oriented and reliable, while UDP is non connectionoriented and unreliable.
2. TCP can be used for reliable transmission of large amounts of data, whileUDP can be used for efficient transmission, such as live broadcast.
3. TCP connection can only be point-to-point, while UDP supports one-to-onemany to many, one to many.
4. To ensure the reliability of transmission, TCP will add sequence numbermechanism, confirmation mechanism, etc. on the basis of IP protocolwhich will not lose packets, while UDP will lose packets. The cost of TCp isgreater than that of UDP.
5. 
TCp builds a **byte stream** between two processes. So there's **no natural gap between the two messages:** protocols above (likeHTTP) should make their way to distinguish two adjacent messages.
- HTTP: use CRLF(\\r\\n\\r\\n)
When handled improperly, security issues may arise:

# Internet layer
There are two tasks in this layer :
- Ip address control,
- Routing.
# Ip address control
IP address is dotted decimal data, which divides the IP address into two parts network number + host number.
- Network number: describes the current network segment information
- Host number: it distinguishes the hosts inside the LAN
General requirements: in the same LAN, the network number between hosts is the same, and the host number cannot be the same; The network numbers of two adjacent LANs (connected by the same router) cannot be the same.
To control all ip addresses, for example, for IPv4, there is 32bit space to be allocated. We need some standards and principles: dynamic allocation, NAT and so on. Anyway, each host and network must have its own IP address if it needs Internet.
# Routing
Routing is to find scheme the path. A path should be found between two devices to complete the transmission process. Router is an important role in this process. The algorithm of routing is not introduced here.
A router checks whether it knows your destination ip address:
- If so, the router tells the best path to the destination;
- If not, it tells you which router may know the destination.
# Link layer
The data link layer considers the data transmission between adjacent nodesThis part is not so important.
# How to debug an abnormal connection?
While working, network is a problem we care about. There are some toolswhich can help solve the abnormal connection of Internet.
## Some tools
## ipconfig (check ip address) for Windows / ipconfig for Linux
Input ipconfig in cmd.
![[Pasted image 20240410204251.png]]
If you want to see the DNS or the mac address, input 'ipconfig/all
## ping (test a connection to a specific address)
command: ping + Ip or dns address
![[Pasted image 20240410204306.png]]
As above, 'ping' can test the speed and stability of a connection. We can input 'ping ... -t' to ping somewhere for several hours to test our connection in a period.
# nslookup(test the dns configuration)
command: nslookup
![[Pasted image 20240410204319.png]]
If there is answer such as above, then your local dns address is right.
You can also check the specific dns, input the 'server +dns address'.
![[Pasted image 20240410204327.png]]
Above is the situation of abnormal dns
## tracert (trace the route)command: tracert + ip addr/dns
If we find that using 'ping' to connect an address is invalid, then we can use 'tracert'. (The perion may be a little long). We can add '-d' parameter to accelerate it.
![[Pasted image 20240410204413.png]]
## telnet (test some port of a server)
command: telnet + ip addr/dns + port number
Each service of a server has its port, so we can use 'telnet' to check it. For example, the port number of web service is 80, ftp is 21, dns is 53.Input: " telnet www.baidu.com 80 " in cmd.

If the popup above appears, then the port can be accessed validly.
## curl(get the content of a site)
command: curl + site
- no parameter: send 'GET' request to a site.
- '-d' parameter:send 'POST' request to a site.More usage: http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2019/09/curl-reference.html
## wget
- Check the connection of ip address and port. 
- Be similar to 'curl'
## netstat (display connection, route, interface)
command: netstat \[-a] \[-e] \[-n] \[-o] \[-p Protocol] \[-r] \[-s] \[Interval]
It is always used to check the situation of local Internet connection.

## Summary
Here is only the rough introduction of some Internet tools, you can learn more whiling them. And we always use them together while dealing with abnormal connections.
- For example, you can use 'ping' to check some connection to a server, then use 'telnet' to direct the port or use 'tracert' to trace the Internet, finally use 'curl' to send a 'POST' request.
There are also other tools not mentioned here, but many problems can be solved if you use tools above expertly.
# Tcpdump
## What is 'tcpdump'
- A network tool for Linux.(for system administrators)
- **Tcpdump** is a data-network packet analyzer computer program that runs under a command line interface. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.
- As a classic essential tool on the Internet, tcpdump has become one of the necessary tools for every advanced system administrator to analyze the network and troubleshoot problems with its powerful functions and flexible interception strategies.
- Just a brief introduction above


# How to use
command: tcpdump \[-aAbdDefhHI]KILnNOpqStuUvxX#] \[ -B size ] \[ -c count ][ -C file_size ][ -E algo:secret ][ -F file ] [ -G
seconds
number
[-i interface ][ -j tstamptype ][ -M secret ][ -
[ -Q in|out|inout ]
precision ]
file ]
postrotate-command]
[-r file ][ -s snapple ][ --time-stamp-precision
[ --immediate-mode ][ -T type ][ --version ][ -V
[ -w file ][ -W filecount ] [ -y datalinktype ][ -z
[-Z user ][ expression ]
Output form: system time + port of source host > port of destination host +parameter of data packet.
If there is no parameter, 'tcpdump' will search the first network interface in thesystem and display all the data it capture. Obviously, there are uselessmessages that we do not want to get like this.
so the key to use tcpdump is to select the valid message for us.
# Expression
Tcpdump uses regular expressions as the conditions for filtering packets. If thepackets meet the conditions of expressions, they will be captured. If noconditions are given, all packets on the network will be intercepted. Commonkeywords in expressions are as follows:
- Keywords specifying parameter types mainly include 'host', 'net', 'port', etc. if no type is specified, the default type is host;
- Keywords specifying the transmission direction of data messages, mainly including 'src', 'dst'.
- Keywords specifying of the protocol, mainly including 'FDDI', 'IP', 'ARP''RARP', 'TCP', 'UDp' and other types, and listen to the packets of all protocols by default;
- Other important keywords: 'gateway', 'broadcast', "ess', 'greater', and three logical operations.
The usage of expression is very flexible and effective, which can help us simplify our problem remarkably.


# Parameter
Here are some useful parameter of 'tcpdump'
- -a print out all packets in ASCII format and minimize the header of the linklayer.
- -b select protocols on the data link layer, including IP, ARP, RARP and IPX.-c after receiving the specified number of packets, tcpdump will stop.-D print out all network interfaces in the system that can use tcpdump to intercept packets.
- -I specify the network interface to listen to.
- ’-L change the standard output into a buffered line form, and you can export the data to a file.
- -N does not convert network addresses into names
- -0 do not run the packet matching code optimizer.
- -g fast output. Only a small amount of protocol information is output.
- -W write the group directly to the file instead of not analyzing and printingit out.
